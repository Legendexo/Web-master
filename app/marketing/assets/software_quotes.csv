" Bill Gates "," Software is a great combination between artistry and engineering. "
" Ray Kurzweil "," Biology is a software process. Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells, each governed by this process. You and I are walking around with outdated software running in our bodies, which evolved in a very different era. "
"  ","  "
" Bill Gates "," Software innovation, like almost every other kind of innovation, requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people, and to sit down and talk with customers and get their feedback and understand their needs. "
" Craig Bruce "," It's hardware that makes a machine fast. It's software that makes a fast machine slow. "
" Edgar Bronfman, Jr. "," You need to look no further than Apple's iPhone to see how fast brilliantly written software presented on a beautifully designed device with a spectacular user interface will throw all the accepted notions about pricing, billing platforms and brand loyalty right out the window. "
" Adam Osborne "," Venture capitalists are like lemmings jumping on the software bandwagon. "
" Markus Persson "," If you build a car, you can only sell it once. If you paint a fence, you only get paid for it once. If you create a piece of software that's essentially free to reproduce, you can keep getting paid over and over perpetually. "
" Alan Cooper "," There's a fundamental problem with how the software business does things. We're asking people who are masters of hard-edged technology to design the soft, human side of software as well. As a result, they make products that are really cool - if you happen to be a software engineer. "
" Norman Ralph Augustine "," Software is like entropy. It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the second law of thermodynamics; i.e. it always increases. "
"  ","  "
" Steve Jobs "," The engineering is long gone in most PC companies. In the consumer electronics companies, they don't understand the software parts of it. And so you really can't make the products that you can make at Apple anywhere else right now. Apple's the only company that has everything under one roof. "
" Naveen Jain "," Education should not be about building more schools and maintaining a system that dates back to the Industrial Revolution. We can achieve so much more, at unmatched scale with software and interactive learning. "
" Matt Mullenweg "," While I personally believe strongly in the philosophy and ideology of the Free Software movement, you can't win people over just on philosophy; you have to have a better product, too. "
" Marc Andreessen "," Today's leading real-world retailer, Wal-Mart, uses software to power its logistics and distribution capabilities, which it has used to crush its competition. "
" Fred Wilson "," My venture investing career has three phases, all roughly 6-8 years long. The first, at Euclid, was software to Internet. The second, at Flatiron, was Internet to bubble. And the third, at USV, has been web 2 to mobile. I have always used a new firm to denote a new investment phase for me. Throw away the old. Start with the new. "
" Michio Kaku "," You can mass-produce hardware; you cannot mass-produce software - you cannot mass-produce the human mind. "
"  ","  "
" Jonathan Ive "," It is sad that so many designers don't know how to make. CAD software can make a bad design look palatable! It is sad that four years can be spent on a 3D design course without making anything! People who are great at designing and making have a great advantage. "
" Whitfield Diffie "," It's simply unrealistic to depend on secrecy for security in computer software. You may be able to keep the exact workings of the program out of general circulation, but can you prevent the code from being reverse-engineered by serious opponents? Probably not. The secret to strong security: less reliance on secrets. "
" Craig Venter "," Since my own genome was sequenced, my software has been broadcast into space in the form of electromagnetic waves, carrying my genetic information far beyond Earth. Whether there is any creature out there capable of making sense of the instructions in my genome, well, that's another question. "
" Jamie Zawinski "," Software Engineering might be science; but that's not what I do. I'm a hacker, not an engineer. "
" Douglas Rushkoff "," Google did a great job hacking the Web to create search - and then monetizing search with advertising. And Apple did a great job humanizing hardware and software so that formerly daunting computers and applications could become consumer-friendly devices - even a lifestyle brand. "
" Steve Jobs "," Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn. "
" Deepak Chopra "," Karma, memory, and desire are just the software of the soul. It's conditioning that the soul undergoes in order to create experience. And it's a cycle. In most people, the cycle is a conditioned response. They do the same things over and over again. "
"  ","  "
" Bill Gates "," The way to be successful in the software world is to come up with breakthrough software, and so whether it's Microsoft Office or Windows, its pushing that forward. New ideas, surprising the marketplace, so good engineering and good business are one in the same. "
" Linus Torvalds "," Software is like sex: it's better when it's free. "
" Nina Easton "," Jobless workers, especially those out of work for months and years, don't have the skills to multitask in a fast-paced economy where medical workers need to know electronic record-keeping, machinists need computer skills, and marketing managers can no longer delegate software duties. "
" Tim O'Reilly "," We're entering a new world in which data may be more important than software. "
" Alan Perlis "," In software systems it is often the early bird that makes the worm. "
" Marc Andreessen "," In short, software is eating the world. "
" Mark Cuban "," We can't ever forget that the Internet now is just a staid utility. The exciting platforms are software applications that are very, very simple. "
" Alan Kay "," People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware. "
" Al Gore "," Our democracy, our constitutional framework is really a kind of software for harnessing the creativity and political imagination for all of our people. The American democratic system was an early political version of Napster. "
" Alan Perlis "," Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to always see it as a soap bubble? "
" William Gibson "," Why shouldn't we give our teachers a license to obtain software, all software, any software, for nothing? Does anyone demand a licensing fee, each time a child is taught the alphabet? "
" Joe Clark "," 'Authoring tools' are terrible; there is almost no software that can create closed captions for media players. And of course there is no training. TV captioning is bad enough, and this stuff is generally worse. "
" Lawrence Lessig "," By the time Apple's Macintosh operating system finally falls into the public domain, there will be no machine that could possibly run it. The term of copyright for software is effectively unlimited. "
" Wietse Venema "," Defect-free software does not exist. "
" Wietse Venema "," For many people my software is something that you install and forget. I like to keep it that way. "
" Marc Andreessen "," Qualified software engineers, managers, marketers and salespeople in Silicon Valley can rack up dozens of high-paying, high-upside job offers any time they want, while national unemployment and underemployment is sky high. "
" Alan Kay "," Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves. "
" Nicholas Negroponte "," It's hard to propose a $100 laptop for a world community of kids and then not say in the same breath that you're going to depend on the community to make software for it. "
" Bob Barr "," It is not just software glitches and corrupted memory cards that should be on the minds of election officials. Hackers pose another very real problem whereby an election could be tilted towards a favored candidate. "
" Dave Parnas "," When someone builds a bridge, he uses engineers who have been certified as knowing what they are doing. Yet when someone builds you a software program, he has no similar certification, even though your safety may be just as dependent upon that software working as it is upon the bridge supporting your weight. "
" Marc Andreessen "," The joke about SAP has always been, it's making '50s German manufacturing methodology, implemented in 1960s software technology, delivered to 1970-style manufacturing organizations, like, it's really - yeah, the incumbency - they are still the lingering hangover from the dot-com crash. "
" Aaron Levie "," If you think about the market that we're in, and more broadly just the enterprise software market, the kind of transition that's happening right now from legacy systems to the cloud is literally, by definition, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. "
" Aaron Levie "," The business models in enterprise have changed pretty dramatically. A huge problem with enterprise software traditionally has been usually you sell to the customer and then they adopt the technology. The great thing about 'freemium' and the new way enterprise software is being sold is you get to try it first and then buy it. "
" Marc Benioff "," I always knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I started my own software company in high school and went to college to study entrepreneurship. "
" Matt Mullenweg "," When I first got into technology I didn't really understand what open source was. Once I started writing software, I realized how important this would be. "
" Matt Mullenweg "," We're not done yet, but two things WordPress has been able to exemplify is that open source can create great user experiences and that it's possible to have a successful commercial entity and a wider free software community living and working in harmony. "
" Matt Mullenweg "," As the web becomes more and more of a part of our every day lives, it would be a horrible tragedy if it was locked up inside of companies and proprietary software. "
" Emmett Shear "," A goal of Twitch is to be wherever gamers are, whether it's on laptops and handheld devices or integrated into gaming consoles and software. "
" John Katzman "," After graduation, I took a job with Manufacturers Hanover Trust in software development. I don't think I was there more than a month. "
" Nathan Myhrvold "," If I say I've got two versions of Word - that old one from 1982 that's perfect, with zero defects; or the new one that's got all this cool new stuff, but there might be a few bugs in it - people always want the new one. But I wouldn't want them to operate a plane I was on with software that happened to be the latest greatest release! "
" Erik Brynjolfsson "," There are lots of examples of routine, middle-skilled jobs that involve relatively structured tasks, and those are the jobs that are being eliminated the fastest. Those kinds of jobs are easier for our friends in the artificial intelligence community to design robots to handle them. They could be software robots; they could be physical robots. "
" Dennis Ritchie "," Any editing, software work, and mail is done in this exported Plan 9. "
" Guido van Rossum "," I have this hope that there is a better way. Higher-level tools that actually let you see the structure of the software more clearly will be of tremendous value. "
" Fred Brooks "," Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later. "
" Kevin Mitnick "," Most people assume that once security software is installed, they're protected. This isn't the case. It's critical that companies be proactive in thinking about security on a long-term basis. "
" Niklaus Wirth "," Software development is technical activity conducted by human beings. "
" Jack Welch "," The 1980s will seem like a walk in the park when compared to new global challenges, where annual productivity increases of 6% may not be enough. A combination of software, brains, and running harder will be needed to bring that percentage up to 8% or 9%. "
" Dave Parnas "," As a rule, software systems do not work well until they have been used, and have failed repeatedly, in real applications. "
" Arthur C. Clarke "," Reading computer manuals without the hardware is as frustrating as reading sex manuals without the software. "
" Richard Stallman "," Fighting patents one by one will never eliminate the danger of software patents, any more than swatting mosquitoes will eliminate malaria. "
" Ken Olsen "," Software comes from heaven when you have good hardware. "
" Adam Osborne "," With bundled machines you can throw away the hardware and keep the software, and it's still a good buy. "
" Dave Winer "," You get the software you pay for. In every sense. To the nth degree. That's the way the world works. "
" Nat Friedman "," It's probably fair to say that the ratio of time our Connector developers spend in the debugger versus the Emacs buffer is higher than with most software. "
" Nat Friedman "," Red Carpet Enterprise has been really well received since one guy can install it in about an hour, and it makes it trivial to deal with software management issues like deploying updates and creating standard package sets for your various machines. "
" Will Wright "," I'm not saying we purposely introduced bugs or anything, but this is kind of a natural result of any complexities of software... that you can't fully test it. "
" John McAfee "," Limit use of shareware and public domain software to systems without fixed disks. If you do use them on fixed disks, allocate separate subdirectories... Public domain or shareware software should never be placed in the root directory. "
" Bill Griffith "," I just became one with my browser software. "
" Edward Tufte "," I think it is important for software to avoiding imposing a cognitive style on workers and their work. "
" Trip Hawkins "," None of our competitors have ever made two systems that run the same software. "
" Trip Hawkins "," We also had good software in the key categories and more focus on the gameplaying capability, so more of the marketing effort was targeted at game customers. "
" Steven Levy "," I think that the most beautiful thing lately hasn't been in hardware or software per se but collaboration - the idea behind Napster, which uses the distributed power of the Internet as its engine. "
" John Baldacci "," There is a lot of interest in the arts, music, theatre, filmmaking, engineering, architecture and software design. I think we have now transitioned the modern-day version of the entrepreneur into the creative economy. "
" Sanjay Kumar "," So far, Indian companies have focused more on customer application. This needs to shift to packaged software for sectors such as banking and financial services. "
" Kevin Mitnick "," So what I was essentially doing was, I compromised the confidentiality of their proprietary software to advance my agenda of becoming the best at breaking through the lock. "
" Greg Egan "," Diaspora starts about a thousand years from now. Most of human civilisation has moved inside computers; essentially, a major branch of our descendants consists of conscious software. "
" Hilary Rosen "," For music, unlike a $500 software program, people are paying a buck or two a song, and it's those dollars and pennies that have to add up to pay for not just the cost of that song, but the investment in the next song. "
" Bill Budge "," I really think it is amazing that people actually buy software. "
" Glenn Turner "," As every new breed of virus is conceived, created and released into the wild, another small change is made to the anti-virus software to combat the new threat. "
" Glenn Turner "," There is one major problem with anti-virus software: It needs updating. Users cannot be relied upon to have even the anti-virus software in the first place, let alone be able or willing to pay for the updates. "
" Jamie Zawinski "," Of course, all of the software I write runs on Linux; that's the beauty of standards, and of cross-platform code. I don't have to run your OS, and you don't have to run mine, and we can use the same applications anyway! "
" Andy Hertzfeld "," I developed some unique software to public it on the web that I call the Folklore Project. "
" Andy Hertzfeld "," I got bitten by the free software bug in February of 1998 around the time of the Mozilla announcement. "
" Shawn Fanning "," I think the most difficult thing had been scaling the infrastructure. Trying to support the response we had received from our users and the number of people that were interested in using the software. "
" Wietse Venema "," This will surprise some of your readers, but my primary interest is not with computer security. I am primarily interested in writing software that works as intended. "
" Wietse Venema "," Writing software that's safe even in the presence of bugs makes the challenge even more interesting. "
" Wietse Venema "," When I write software, I know that it will fail, either due to my own mistake, or due to some other cause. "
" Wietse Venema "," The Postfix security model is based on keeping software simple and stupid. "
" Wietse Venema "," I want to avoid locking people into solutions that work only with Postfix. People should have a choice in what software they want to use with Postfix, be it anti-virus or otherwise. "
" Wietse Venema "," Most of the effort in the software business goes into the maintenance of code that already exists. "
" Wietse Venema "," The challenge with Postfix, or with any piece of software, is to update software without introducing problems. "
" Wietse Venema "," My reply is: the software has no known bugs, therefore it has not been updated. "
" Mike Marsh "," The scanning of barcodes, or the reading of RFID transponders, generates data that is used in a software package to provide management or control information. "
" Linus Torvalds "," People enjoy the interaction on the Internet, and the feeling of belonging to a group that does something interesting: that's how some software projects are born. "
" Linus Torvalds "," When it comes to software, I much prefer free software, because I have very seldom seen a program that has worked well enough for my needs, and having sources available can be a life-saver. "
" Dave Rowntree "," The days when you needed amazing Silicon Graphics machines to run animation software are gone now. "
" Douglas Coupland "," We decided that the French could never write user-friendly software because they're so rude. "
" James Levine "," Most people treat the office manual the way they treat a software manual. They never look at it. "
" Marc Andreessen "," More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services - from movies to agriculture to national defense. "
" Marc Andreessen "," My own theory is that we are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy. "
" Marc Andreessen "," Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not. "
" Marc Andreessen "," The days when a car aficionado could repair his or her own car are long past, due primarily to the high software content. "
" Marc Andreessen "," Companies in every industry need to assume that a software revolution is coming. "
" Marc Andreessen "," On the back end, software programming tools and Internet-based services make it easy to launch new global software-powered start-ups in many industries - without the need to invest in new infrastructure and train new employees. "
" Marc Andreessen "," Perhaps the single most dramatic example of this phenomenon of software eating a traditional business is the suicide of Borders and corresponding rise of Amazon. "
" Reed Hastings "," My first company, Pure Software, was exciting and innovative in the first few years and bureaucratic and painful in the last few before it got acquired. The problem was we tried to systemize everything and set up perfect procedures. "
" Marc Andreessen "," There is a constant need for new systems and new software. "
" Marc Andreessen "," TV and the press have always functioned according to the same sets of rules and technical standards. But the Internet is based on software. And anybody can write a new piece of software on the Internet that years later a billion people are using. "
" Shigeru Miyamoto "," Of course, I have my own limits as to how much game software I can take care of at any one time. "
" Bill Gates "," I was lucky to be involved and get to contribute to something that was important, which is empowering people with software. "
" Jimmy Wales "," A lot of people who work on open-source software don't mind making money elsewhere. They aren't anticommercial. "
" Curt Schilling "," There's not a long track record of people leaving professional sports to become a software developer. "
" Kevin Mitnick "," I think malware is a significant threat because the mitigation, like antivirus software, hasn't evolved to a point to really mitigate the risk to a reasonable degree. "
" Kevin Mitnick "," For the average home-user, anti-virus software is a must. "
" Richard Stallman "," If you use a proprietary program or somebody else's web server, you're defenceless. You're putty in the hands of whoever developed that software. "
" Richard Stallman "," Proprietary software tends to have malicious features. The point is with a proprietary program, when the users don't have the source code, we can never tell. So you must consider every proprietary program as potential malware. "
" Richard Stallman "," Free software is software that respects your freedom and the social solidarity of your community. So it's free as in freedom. "
" Richard Stallman "," Proprietary software is an injustice. "
" Richard Stallman "," In the free/libre software movement, we develop software that respects users' freedom, so we and you can escape from software that doesn't. "
" Richard Stallman "," Software patents are dangerous to software developers because they impose monopolies on software ideas. "
" Sam Wyly "," Originally, I was in both software and in online computing. The first innovation really was sort of at that time that we're marrying the telephone and the computer so that people wouldn't have to drive to the computer center. We didn't have $1,000 computers. "
" David Byrne "," Software constraints are only confining if you use them for what they're intended to be used for. "
" Oren Peli "," By trade, I am a software programmer, so I never really had any experience with movies before. I started out with 'Paranormal Activity.' "
" Susan Wojcicki "," My first job after college was at Magic Quest, an educational software startup company where I was responsible for writing the content. I found that job somewhat accidentally but after working there a few weeks and loving my job, I decided to pursue a career in technology. "
" Jeff Raikes "," At Microsoft, the magic of software is used to take on very interesting challenges. "
" Bill Gross "," Accountants, machinists, medical technicians, even software writers that write the software for 'machines' are being displaced without upscaled replacement jobs. Retrain, rehire into higher paying and value-added jobs? That may be the political myth of the modern era. There aren't enough of those jobs. "
" Naveen Jain "," Early versions of Microsoft Word left a lot to be desired. However, to the company's credit, it quickly learned where Word fell short, made the necessary changes, and repeatedly introduced new versions of the software. "
" Allison Pearson "," The software program for motherhood is impossible to fully download into the male brain. You give them two tasks and they're like, 'I have to change the baby and get the dry cleaning?' "
" Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. "," What we believe is going to be very important is the delivery of traditional software and services and hardware over the Net. That's a form of electronic marketplace. "
" Aaron Levie "," I tend to not discriminate when it comes to people I can learn from. Basically, if someone has built a meaningful business in software, technology or media, faced disruption and adversity, and overcame underdog status, I want to know how they did it. "
" Bill Viola "," The future art historians are going to be software guys who are going to go into the depths of the code to find out what was changed hundreds of years before. "
" Meg Rosoff "," As a person with the retentive mental capacity of a goldfish and a dislike of repetition, I frequently make use of the thesaurus built into my Microsoft Word U.K. Software. "
" Marc Benioff "," I love software and I love technology. "
" Samuel J. Palmisano "," Enterprise is hard work. You have to integrate the client with the optimized systems of all the servers and software. "
" Marco Arment "," Apple already had everyone's billing information from iTunes... you could buy things just by typing in your password... That, for the first time, brought very, very easy payment to the modern software world. That, more than anything, is why there is a business for paid apps. "
" Matt Mullenweg "," WordPress.com is the only service of its kind that not only lets you export your data, but gives you an open source package you can run on pretty much any web host out there to run your own instance of the software. So the freedom is really in your hands. "
" Nathan Myhrvold "," In the early days of the software industry, people cared about copyright and didn't give a damn about patents - they copied each other willy-nilly. "
" Nathan Myhrvold "," If you want to do interesting software, you have to have a bunch of people do it, because the amount of software that one person can do isn't that interesting. "
" Barry Schuler "," By being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism, the software, if you will, changes the hardware. "
" Marco Tempest "," Magicians are typically introverted; they don't tend to work with others, but I work with software programmers, composers, designers, so it's a very diverse group and the result is always more interesting than something I could have done by myself. "
" Walt Mossberg "," We need a wireless mobile device ecosystem that mirrors the PC/Internet ecosystem, one where the consumers' purchase of network capacity is separate from their purchase of the hardware and software they use on that network. It will take government action, or some disruptive technology or business innovation, to get us there. "
" Geoff Mulgan "," Predation is part of the everyday life of capitalism, in sectors as mainstream as pharmaceuticals, software and oil - where people's money, their data, their time and their attention are routinely taken in fundamentally asymmetrical exchanges. "
" Howard Rheingold "," Technology no longer consists just of hardware or software or even services, but of communities. Increasingly, community is a part of technology, a driver of technology, and an emergent effect of technology. "
" Janine Benyus "," Trees and bones are constantly reforming themselves along lines of stress. This algorithm has been put into a software program that's now being used to make bridges lightweight, to make building beams lightweight. "
" Elon Musk "," Trying to read our DNA is like trying to understand software code - with only 90% of the code riddled with errors. It's very difficult in that case to understand and predict what that software code is going to do. "
" Douglas Rushkoff "," The reason why Apple computers have worked so well over time is that, unlike Microsoft, they don't bend over backward to be compatible with every piece of hardware or software in the digital universe. To code or create for Apple, you follow Apple's rules. If you're even allowed to. "
" Linus Torvalds "," Hey, I'm a good software engineer, but I'm not exactly known for my fashion sense. White socks and sandals don't translate to 'good design sense'. "
" Linus Torvalds "," There were open source projects and free software before Linux was there. Linux in many ways is one of the more visible and one of the bigger technical projects in this area, and it changed how people looked at it because Linux took both the practical and ideological approach. "
" Linus Torvalds "," I think, fundamentally, open source does tend to be more stable software. It's the right way to do things. "
" Satya Nadella "," Everything is going to be connected to cloud and data... All of this will be mediated by software. "
" John Lasseter "," Every young person gets so excited about new software packages and new technology. "
" Brian Eno "," In the future, you won't buy artists' works; you'll buy software that makes original pieces of 'their' works, or that recreates their way of looking at things. You could buy a Shostakovich box, or you could buy a Brahms box. You might want some Shostakovich slow-movement-like music to be generated. So then you use that box. "
" Vint Cerf "," The Internet browser is the most susceptible to viruses. The browser is naive about downloading and executing software. Google is trying to help by releasing the Chrome browser as open source. "
" Kevin Mitnick "," For the average home-user, anti-virus software is a must. A personal firewall such as Zone Alarm and running a program like HFNetcheck, which is a free download for personal users. It checks your system to see if anything needs to be patched. I'd also recommend a program such as SpyCop to periodically check for any spyware on your system. "
" Vivek Wadhwa "," One of the biggest problems that software developers face is that technology changes rapidly. It is very hard to stay current. "
" Michael Arrington "," Talking about Apple v. Microsoft without mentioning the Internet and the browser is like talking about WWII without talking about the nuke. Framing the conversation just in terms of open v. closed operating systems, the quality of the hardware or software or who the CEO was, is silly. "
" Larry Ellison "," Be careful about virtual relationships with artificially intelligent pieces of software. "
" Michael J. Saylor "," There's nothing more frustrating than seeing cynics sit there and say, 'Well, nobody can make any more money because Microsoft and Intel own everything.' Is the software industry mature, or is it embryonic? I would say it's embryonic. There will be a hundred more Microsofts, not just one. "
" Bill Gates "," Software substitution, whether it's for drivers or waiters or nurses - it's progressing. Technology over time will reduce demand for jobs, particularly at the lower end of skill set. "
" Bill Gates "," Some people, through luck and skill, end up with a lot of assets. If you're good at kicking a ball, writing software, investing in stocks, it pays extremely well. "
" Bill Gates "," When Paul Allen and I started Microsoft over 30 years ago, we had big dreams about software. We had dreams about the impact it could have. "
" Bill Gates "," Certainly there's a phenomenon around open source. You know free software will be a vibrant area. There will be a lot of neat things that get done there. "
" Bill Gates "," Paper is no longer a big part of my day. I get 90% of my news online, and when I go to a meeting and want to jot things down, I bring my Tablet PC. It's fully synchronized with my office machine, so I have all the files I need. It also has a note-taking piece of software called OneNote, so all my notes are in digital form. "
" Bill Gates "," Microsoft Research has a thing called the Sense Cam that, as you walk around, it's taking photos all the time. And the software will filter and find the ones that are interesting without having to think, 'Let's get out the camera and get that shot.' You just have that, and software helps you pick what you want. "
" Bill Gates "," A lot of people assume that creating software is purely a solitary activity where you sit in an office with the door closed all day and write lots of code. "
" Shashi Tharoor "," We've gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails, and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick, to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses, computer wizards, software gurus. "
" Tyler Cowen "," Some Google employees have their self-driving vehicles take them to work. These car robots don't look like something from 'The Jetsons'; the driverless features on these cars are a bunch of sensors, wires, and software. This technology 'works.' "
" Tyler Cowen "," In the early stages of negotiation software, on your smartphone, there may be programs that listen to the pitch of a voice, or that test for stress. You'll just ask the program, 'Was he lying? Was he eager to do business with me?' Maybe the computer will be right sixty per cent of the time. "
" Tyler Cowen "," I see three forces militating in favor of growing inequality: increasing measurement of worker value added, automation through smart software, and globalization. "
" Tony Fadell "," Google has the business resources, global scale and platform reach to accelerate Nest growth across hardware, software and services for the home globally. "
" Barton Gellman "," Most computers today have built in backup software. "
" Barton Gellman "," A minimum precaution: keep your anti-malware protections up to date, and install security updates for all your software as soon as they arrive. "
" Matt Mullenweg "," The more money Automattic makes, the more we invest into Free and Open Source software that belongs to everybody and services to make that software sing. "
" Matt Mullenweg "," I'm really good at making software for publishing. "
" Matt Mullenweg "," It seems like the web, particularly software as a service, provides ample opportunities for you to flourish economically, completely aligned with the broader open source community. "
" Alan G. Poindexter "," Flying in space is risky. It will never be safe, and the best thing we can do is manage those risks. It's important for people, for human beings, to be in space because they're adaptable and because they're not pre-programmed software that can go off and do tasks that are appropriate for machines. "
" Richard Stallman "," Many users of the GNU/Linux system will not have heard the ideas of free software. They will not be aware that we have ideas, that a system exists because of ethical ideals, which were omitted from ideas associated with the term 'open source.' "
" Richard Stallman "," The idea of free software is that users of computing deserve freedom. They deserve in particular to have control over their computing. And proprietary software does not allow users to have control of their computing. "
" Richard Stallman "," A smartphone is a computer - it's not built using a computer - the job it does is the job of being a computer. So, everything we say about computers, that the software you run should be free - you should insist on that - applies to smart phones just the same. And likewise to those tablets. "
" Jonathan Zittrain "," Despite outsiders being invited to write software, the iPhone thus remains tightly tethered to its vendor - the way that the Kindle is controlled by Amazon. "
" Elon Musk "," To make an embarrassing admission, I like video games. That's what got me into software engineering when I was a kid. I wanted to make money so I could buy a better computer to play better video games - nothing like saving the world. "
" Dennis Crowley "," Whatever way that we have in our head that we expect people to use a software, they'll find other interesting ways to use it that we didn't expect. "
" Daniel Suarez "," If you want to be a modern citizen of the world, you have to be minimally capable in technology. It's a new literacy test. Technology rules your outcome in life. And software is making a lot of decisions in our lives. "
" Xavier Niel "," Mark Zuckerberg did his own software for Facebook, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin made their own for Google. "
" Xavier Niel "," If you know how to make software, then you can create big things. "
" Xavier Niel "," I know one business, and that's how to make software. "
" Lael Brainard "," The use of pirated software in China is really quite a sizeable loss to our software producers. "
" Shane Carruth "," I got a degree in math, from not a good school in Texas, and then I went to work as a software engineer. Just not glamorous at all. "
" Tim O'Reilly "," One of the big changes at the heart of Web 2.0 is the shift from the creation of software artifacts, which is what the PC revolution was about, to the creation of software services. These are services that ultimately, if they are successful, will require competencies of operation, of scale, and the like. "
" Tim O'Reilly "," Proprietary software grew up, starting really in the 1980s, as an alternative and that became the dominant model with the rise of companies like Microsoft and Oracle and the like. "
" Hasso Plattner "," I made my money with software - encoded knowledge without which few products and services can exist today - and so it seemed imperative that this would be the field where I would give something back. "
" Judith Faulkner "," I get so many requests for interviews. If I talk to everyone, we can't do our job with our customers and work on our software. It would be hard to stay focused. "
" Mitch Kapor "," The critical thing in developing software is not the program, it's the design. It is translating understanding of user needs into something that can be realized as a computer program. "
" Barry Ritholtz "," The electronics industry expanded rapidly and the seeds for the semiconductor and software revolution were planted. The postwar period also saw the suburbanization of America, the rise of the homeowner, the build-out of the interstate highway system, and the rise of automobile culture. Credit availability expanded dramatically. "
" N. Robert Hammer "," Product pricing is aligned to the way customers want to acquire their solutions and are delivered via different delivery models including appliances, the cloud, or as on-premise software solutions. "
" Fabrice Grinda "," I actually think the one who is underestimated in terms of impact he's had on society is Bill Gates. The reason is that with the innovation of software, he really allowed the computer revolution to take hold. "
" Craig Venter "," How we understand our own selves and how we work with our DNA software has implications that will affect everything from vaccine development to new approaches to antibiotics, new sources of food, new sources of chemicals, even potentially new sources of energy. "
" Anders Hejlsberg "," It gives you great pleasure to know that millions of developers, day to day, make their living using the software that you created. "
" Rob Pike "," We're systems software people ourselves. We wanted a language to make our lives better. "
" Hans Vestberg "," You don't need to recall 100,000 cars because you need to fix something. That can be done with a download of software. "
" Kent Beck "," The problem is, in software design, often the consequences of your decisions don't become apparent for years. "
" Kent Beck "," There is a strong movement towards increased accountability for software developers and software development organizations. "
" Kent Beck "," Developer testing is an important step towards accountability. It gives developers a way to demonstrate the quality of the software they produce. "
" Kent Beck "," Agitator and the Agitar Management Dashboard lower the barriers to accountability in software development and increase the value of developer testing. "
" Kent Beck "," Received wisdom is that if you spend time up front getting the design right, you avoid costs later. But the longer you spend getting the design right, the more your upfront costs are, and the longer it takes for the software to start earning. "
" Kent Beck "," I found out that most programmers don't like to test their software as intensely as I do. "
" Evan Osnos "," The only real mystery in the stories of political plagiarism is its durability in an age of Turnitin and other scanning software that can protect an author from his own mistakes, intentional or otherwise. "
" Leila Janah "," Using the Internet to secure employment is as vital to a construction worker as it is to a software engineer. "
" Alan Cooper "," We're building what I call 'software apartheid.' We're in the process of creating a divided society: those who can use technology on one side, and those who can't on the other. And it happens to divide neatly along economic lines. "
" Alan Cooper "," If we want users to like our software, we should design it to behave like a likeable person. "
" Alan Cooper "," The payoff of a customer-centric approach to software and digital product design is substantial and long-lasting for both companies and their customers. "
" Jon Evans "," I am very happily employed as a full-time software engineer; I travel a lot, and I write books along with this here weekly TechCrunch column; and I still find the time to work on my own software side projects. "
" Nicholas Kristof "," I wouldn't want everybody to be an art or literature major, but the world would be poorer - figuratively, anyway - if we were all coding software or running companies. We also want musicians to awaken our souls, writers to lead us into fictional lands, and philosophers to help us exercise our minds and engage the world. "
" Jack Dangermond "," We support about 5,000 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with software, training, and technical support. We provide our software at virtually no cost to them, and they're lighting up the world with what they do. "
" Carol Berg "," I'm a fairly ordinary person - a lifelong reader, a former software engineer, and former math teacher. I come from a wonderful family of teachers, musicians, librarians, and engineers. I think I surprised them as well as my friends and coworkers when I took up writing as a hobby and let it take over my life! "
" Nick Hanauer "," In software, it's easy to understand what people want, and it's hard to build. Internet stuff is super easy to build, but it's hard to know what people want. "
" Ren Ng "," Yes, we are a producer of cameras, but we understand that at the end of the day, you have to make photos in software. A lot of companies focus on the camera side, and a lot are on the software side. There's a chasm between the two. "
" Mike Krieger "," You can't start a product simply by building it. You have to know why you're building it, and you might go down the wrong rabbit hole, waste time, and confuse things. Spending long afternoons with a sketchbook or talking through your ideas with other people can save a year in software development later on. "
" John C. Mather "," Easytrak is no guarantee against mismanagement. But you cannot manage a large program without software like it today. It is a project information management system that helps people develop a solution to a problem with many parts to track. "
" Satya Nadella "," If every sector of business and society will be driven by software - how does that get enabled? By highly-paid computer scientists funded by risk capital in Silicon Valley? Or by lots of engineers who can build it themselves? "
" Satya Nadella "," In the past, there was hardware, software, and platforms on top of which there were applications. Now they're getting conflated. That is all going to get disrupted by the move to the cloud. "
" Satya Nadella "," We're not in hardware for hardware's sake. We're in hardware to be able to express all our platform and productivity software in a way that's unique. "
" Suzan DelBene "," The SP-i600 by Samsung with Windows Mobile software provides a great mobile phone experience that allows mobile professionals to be more productive and effectively manage their busy lives with seamless access to their data and the Internet when they are away from the office. "
" Steve Ballmer "," From a client perspective, I really think the work Microsoft's doing with Surface, with HoloLens, with Xbox, that stuff's absolutely essential to the company's future. Because innovation in the future will either be from the cloud out to all devices, or from devices as supported by software in the cloud. "
" John Carmack "," When it became clear that I wasn't going to have the opportunity to do any work on VR while at id software, I decided to not renew my contract. "
" Fabrizio Moreira "," There is enough of free-of-charge software available on the Net to ease building internet websites and contact pages, as well as implement email marketing campaigns. "
" Fabrizio Moreira "," Many people think that being a graphic designer means going to an expensive art school and buying expensive software that will cost you thousands of dollars. This is so far from the truth. There are hundreds of online education centers that offer top-notch graphic design training. "
" Safra A. Catz "," Oracle is my second job ever that did not involve waitressing. But I still have my waitress apron just in case this does not work out. It's just that I fell in love with software when I was programming in college. When I was an investment banker, there were mostly mainframe companies and very few software ones. "
" Safra A. Catz "," First of all, we have infrastructure as a service, which Amazon has; we have platform as a service, which Microsoft has; we have software as a service; we have applications. Nobody has everything except us. We also have data as a service. "
" Ryan Bethencourt "," I imagine a day, some time in the not too distant future when children and teenagers will be able to create their own genetically engineered machines, cure the diseases of the old and find new ways to build and extend the capabilities of humanity, moving from programming software to programing the physical world, through biology. "
" Azim Premji "," In any software work, you have IT consultancy competence required to build the systems. "
" Russell M. Nelson "," Even more amazing than modern technology is our opportunity to access information directly from Heaven, without hardware, software, or monthly service fees. "
" Walter O'Brien "," As software engineers trained to turn ambiguity into absolutes and fuzzy requirements into ones and zeros, we had a 'eureka' moment when we realized that our training had broader, real-world applications. "
" Walter O'Brien "," The methodologies and best practices used to develop software can be applied successfully to any challenge in life. "
" Mark Cuban "," Whatever you are studying right now, if you are not getting up to speed on deep learning, neural networks, etc., you lose. We are going through the process where software will automate software, automation will automate automation. "
" Michael J. Saylor "," Instead of five hundred thousand average algebra teachers, we need one good algebra teacher. We need that teacher to create software, videotape themselves, answer questions, let your computer or the iPad teach algebra... The hallmark of any good technology is that it destroys jobs. "
" Linus Torvalds "," Shareware tends to combine the worst of commercial software with the worst of free software. "
" Judith R. Faulkner "," I get so many requests for interviews. If I talk to everyone, we can't do our job with our customers and work on our software. It would be hard to stay focused. "
" Craig Venter "," Life is a DNA software system. "
" Alan Cox "," All software sucks. "
" Bill Gates "," Whether it's Google or Apple or free software, we've got some fantastic competitors and it keeps us on our toes. "
" Howard Gardner "," Twenty-five years ago, the notion was you could create a general problem-solver software that could solve problems in many different domains. That just turned out to be totally wrong. "
" Wietse Venema "," However, writing software without defects is not sufficient. In my experience, it is at least as difficult to write software that is safe - that is, software that behaves reasonably under adverse conditions. "
" Tim Berners-Lee "," Any good software engineer will tell you that a compiler and an interpreter are interchangeable. "
" Richard Stallman "," Also, because schools must teach the spirit of goodwill, the habit of helping others around you, every class should have this rule: students, if you bring software to class you may not keep it for yourself. "
" Timothy Ferriss "," I might seem biased, but I use Evernote every day. It came to me through my readers, who I'd asked for software recommendations via Twitter and Facebook. For seemingly every function, the answer was 'Man, you have to use Evernote.' "
" Brian Behlendorf "," I'm not of the opinion that all software will be open source software. There is certain software that fits a niche that is only useful to a particular company or person: for example, the software immediately behind a web site's user interface. But the vast majority of software is actually pretty generic. "
" Mitchell Baker "," We do care about control and privacy. It's one of the reasons we are so focused on having our systems be open source, so you or someone technically savvy you know can verify what the software is doing. "
" Peter Thiel "," If you're trying to develop a new drug, that costs you a billion dollars to get through the FDA. If you want to start a software company, you can get started with maybe $100,000. "
" Kent Beck "," Organizations want small changes in functionality on a more regular basis. An organization like Flickr deploys a new version of its software every half hour. This is a cycle that feeds on itself. "
" Jay Samit "," When Thomas and John Knoll launched Photoshop 1.0 in 1990, the software couldn't even handle color images. But their offerings got the startup noticed by Apple and Adobe, both of whom became key to the fledgling company's later success. "
" Walter O'Brien "," At Sussex University, I developed a system called WinLocX to help with the process of translating software into foreign languages. "
" Bill Gates "," I'm sorry that we have to have a Washington presence. We thrived during our first 16 years without any of this. I never made a political visit to Washington and we had no people here. It wasn't on our radar screen. We were just making great software. "
" Bill Gates "," Maintaining a consistent platform also helps improve product support - a significant problem in the software industry. "
" Bill Gates "," The only thing I understand deeply, because in my teens I was thinking about it, and every year of my life, is software. So I'll never be hands-on on anything except software. "
" Bill Gates "," The truth of Moore's law has made remarkable things possible. On the software side, I think natural user interfaces in all their forms are equally significant. "
" Bill Gates "," Like any well designed software product, Windows is designed, developed and tested as an integrated whole. "
" Bill Gates "," The common thread for everything I do is this idea of a Web-services architecture. What does that mean? It means taking components of software and systems and having them be self-describing, so that you can aim them, ask them what their capabilities are, and communicate with them using a standard protocol. "
" Bill Gates "," In almost every job now, people use software and work with information to enable their organisation to operate more effectively. "
" Rebecca MacKinnon "," While sanctions against Iran and Syria are intended to constrain those countries' governments, they have had the unfortunate side effect of constraining activists' access to free online software and services used widely across the Middle East, including browsers, online chat applications, and online storage services. "
" Brian Eno "," Software options proliferate extremely easily - too easily, in fact - because too many options create tools that can't ever be used intuitively. Intuitive actions confine the detail work to a dedicated part of the brain, leaving the rest of one's mind free to respond with attention and sensitivity to the changing texture of the moment. "
" Peter Diamandis "," Paul Allen with Microsoft revolutionized the software industry. "
" Craig Venter "," In a biological system, the software builds its own hardware, but design is critical, and if you start with digital information, it has to be really accurate. "
" Alex Berenson "," Automated call centers are only the most obvious way speech recognition will be used. The software is now becoming sophisticated enough to identify speakers through 'voiceprints,' akin to fingerprints, eventually reducing the need for personal identification numbers. "
" Mark Cuban "," For food service industry and retail, I'm for the minimum wage being increased to at least $12. Not for manufacturing. Software and robotics are going to revolutionize manufacturing in the next 10 years. In the meantime, we have to compete with overseas manufacturing. "
" Mark Cuban "," Traditional TV will have to innovate their TV delivery software in new ways beyond just offering their content in an app in order to change the viewing erosion of TV. "
" Barton Gellman "," Given the volume of PC sales and the way McAfee runs its operation, I imagine there must be thousands of phantom subscribers - folks who signed up once upon a time and left the software behind two or three computers ago. "
" Barton Gellman "," I do read licenses, and they aggravate me, but a computer isn't much good without software. When I need a product, I hold my nose and click 'agree.' "
" Barton Gellman "," Ghostery lets you spy on the spies in your computer. For each web page you visit, this extension uncloaks some - but not all - of the invisible tracking software that is working behind the scenes. "
" Kevin Mitnick "," Back in my day, I would probe by hand. Now you can get commercial software that does the job for you. "
" Douglas Rushkoff "," For Google, the problem with being a free, abundant, and rather infinite set of services is that it's hard to create much of a stir about anything. There are so many major software service options under the 'more' menu on the Gmail page that they've had to go and add a final item called 'even more.' "
" Douglas Rushkoff "," Technology has moved away from sharing and toward ownership. This suits software and hardware companies just fine: They create new, bloated programs that require more disk space and processing power. We buy bigger, faster computers, which then require more complex operating systems, and so on. "
" Naveen Jain "," I have absolutely no idea about space exploration. I'm a software guy. But because I'm a non-expert, I've been able to bring the software concept of modularity into the space sector, which was never done before. "
" T. J. Miller "," I know about the tech industry in that I follow what apps are hot and software development. I know my way around different browsers. I know how to restart a computer. "
" Satya Nadella "," I want to see us remain convinced that software matters in the future. "
" Vint Cerf "," Writing software is a very intense, very personal thing. You have to have time to work your way through it, to understand it. Then debug it. "
" Vint Cerf "," For systems in which you already have a lot of hardware and software, change is difficult. That's why apps are so popular. "
" George Packer "," Everything seems set up for success in digital journalism - money, eyeballs, software, brands. "
" Matt Mullenweg "," For me, it always comes back to the blogger, the author, the designer, the developer. You build software for that core individual person, and then smart organisations adopt it and dumb organisations die. "
" Evgeny Morozov "," Free open-source software, by its nature, is unlikely to feature secret back doors that lead directly to Langley, Va. "
" Walt Mossberg "," Whether you are a consumer, a hardware maker, a software developer or a provider of cool new services, it's hard to make a move in the American cellphone world without the permission of the companies that own the pipes. "
" Walt Mossberg "," Our lives and our culture have been significantly changed and improved by hardware, software, and services developed by immigrants. "
" Walt Mossberg "," Lauren Goode and I have agreed that the next version of the Mac software - all of them are named after places in California - should be named either Bridgeport or Warwick. "
" Walt Mossberg "," Apple's advantage is that it designs and builds software together, so if the software isn't excellent, it does the superlative hardware a disservice. "
" Walt Mossberg "," Companies often visit my office, or invite me to theirs, to brief me on new products, Web sites, or software before they are released - usually a few weeks or days ahead of time. I don't review most of these products. "
" Walt Mossberg "," Though the S8, like all premium Samsung phones, runs Android with the basic Google suite of apps, Samsung keeps trying to duplicate Android functions with its own software. It wants to be a software platform like its rival Apple, but it uses someone else's operating system and core apps. Awkward. "
" Walt Mossberg "," As for the device we now call a TV or a cable box, I want it to be fast with a clean interface and seamlessly upgradeable to the latest software. I want it to be the primary source of all TV, not an ancillary device. "
" Flume "," Making sounds that literally no one has ever heard before because the software and the technology's never been there, and pairing that with great songwriting, then that's what's exciting for me. That's what I wanna do. "
" Gene Luen Yang "," I majored in Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley and worked as a software developer for a couple of years. Then I taught high school computer science for over a decade and a half in Oakland, California. "
" Jason Fried "," When we launched the first version of Basecamp in 2004, we decided to build software for small companies just like us. "
" Jason Fried "," We've never much liked the idea of charging a participation tax, a phrase we coined to represent what it feels like when a software company charges you more money for each additional user. Participation taxes discourage usage across a company. "
" Sam Altman "," The way to really scale a venture firm is with software. "
" Sam Altman "," All the reasons that have made software so successful are beginning to happen with hardware. So much can be done so quickly, prototyped so rapidly, and the costs are so low. "
" Mitch Kapor "," I was trying to figure out what to do next, I'd been accumulating ideas for productivity tools - software people could use every day, particularly to help organize their lives. "
" Mitch Kapor "," It became clear to me by 1984 that Microsoft was likely going to be the big winner in the PC software apps and operating system category, partly because of the dynamics of owning and controlling the operating system: that gave you enormous power, and I came to see Bill Gates was fierce competitor. "
" Marvin Ammori "," In software and many other online markets, even dominant firms face potential threats because of the low costs for competitors to enter those markets. Threats more easily emerge because of better or newer technologies leapfrogging older ones. "
" Kevin O'Leary "," Software is becoming no different than a videotape or a record album or a paperback book, and not all of us are ready for that change. "
" Kevin O'Leary "," For whatever reason somebody can be convinced to buy a PC, it opens up a whole new market for all of us in the software business. "
" Mary Roach "," It is interesting to come across people who feel that a ghost communicating via a spell-checker is less far-fetched than a software glitch. "
" Steve Jurvetson "," Machine learning allows us to build software solutions that exceed human understanding and shows us how AI can innervate every industry. "
" John Battelle "," We speak of 'software eating the world,' 'the Internet of Things,' and we massify 'data' by declaring it 'Big.' But these concepts remain for the most part abstract. It's hard for many of us to grasp the impact of digital technology on the 'real world' of things like rocks, homes, cars, and trees. We lack a metaphor that hits home. "
" Ryan Holmes "," No surprise that, as companies have adopted social media en masse, demand for software and applications to manage and monitor social use has exploded. "
" Linus Torvalds "," Software patents, in particular, are very ripe for abuse. The whole system encourages big corporations getting thousands and thousands of patents. Individuals almost never get them. "
" Nick Woodman "," GoPro's capture devices and Kolor's software will combine to deliver exciting and highly accessible solutions for capturing, creating, and sharing spherical content. "
" Jon Oringer "," As I started college, I started to build software products that I could sell to people over the Web. "
" Jon Oringer "," I started Shutterstock out of my own need. I'd previously created a few software companies, and each time, I struggled to find affordable images to use on my websites. "
" Alex Pareene "," Cable boxes are, almost without exception, awful. They're under-powered computers running very badly designed software. Their channel guides are slow, poorly laid out, and usually riddled with ads. "
" Astro Teller "," Google is already overflowing with incredibly creative bright groups already working on lots of the software problems of the world. "
" Astro Teller "," If software's the only thing in your bag of tools, I'm not going to give you great odds. "
" Suzan DelBene "," The i730 combines the familiarity of Windows Mobile software with the innovative design of Samsung that will be a popular choice for mobile professionals. "
" Suzan DelBene "," We are very pleased with Vodafone's decision to adopt Windows Mobile as a preferred software platform for its mobile business. Together, we will deliver services which we expect will help Vodafone achieve cost-efficiencies while delivering new propositions to its customers, thus making Windows Mobile an even more compelling platform. "
" Howard Rheingold "," Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla, can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them. "
" Jidenna "," One day, my mum bought me this music production software for my computer, and I started making beats... I realised it was more like production than a video game, but it was a video game when I was playing it. That's how I got into music production. "
" N. R. Narayana Murthy "," I think India has several advantages in the knowledge sector, in the software sector. "
" N. R. Narayana Murthy "," I think there are opportunities outside India as well as in India. In fact, some of the largest projects that most Indian software companies are doing are in India. "
" Jack Dangermond "," We shifted our philosophy from being a computer mapping group that would support planners to the idea of building actual software that would be well engineered. Because at that time, our software was not well-engineered at all; it was basically built with project funding and for project work, largely by ourselves. "
" Jack Dangermond "," GIS started on mainframe computers; we could get one map every five to 10 hours, and if we made a mistake, it could take longer. In the early '90s, when people started buying PCs, we migrated to desktop software. "
" Fred Wilson "," Yahoo is free, it's fast and it's Web-centric. AOL is slow, it costs money and requires proprietary software. "
" John Carmack "," To the game code, the world is still just a tile map, but for rendering, each map was exported as a general-purpose 3D model, and the artists could then go through it and spend the polygons any way they liked, without the limits of line-of-constant-z software rasterization that we lived with on the mobile phones. "
" John Carmack "," When people heard id Software's being acquired, everybody just assumed it would be Activision or EA. Why would we even consider going with a publisher that wasn't of that same size? "
" Jimmy Wales "," One of the ways that Microsoft beat Apple way back in the day was that they were a lot more open; today, in the world I come from, the free software and open-source world, Microsoft is not generally viewed as open; they're viewed as proprietary. "
" Brendan Iribe "," Oculus is actually more of a software company than it is a hardware company. "
" Julia Glass "," In my fairly disorganized life, yellow stickies are too easily lost, and as for software, I try to avoid using my computer as much more than a typewriter and a post office. I rely on my lifelong habit of daydreaming to spin my stories. "
" Jaron Lanier "," Human beings either function as individuals or as members of a pack. There's a switch inside us, deep in our spirit, that you can turn one way or the other. It's almost always the case that our worst behaviour comes out when we're switched to the mob setting. The problem with a lot of software designs is that they switch us to that setting. "
" Jaron Lanier "," The basic problem is that web 2.0 tools are not supportive of democracy by design. They are tools designed to gather spy-agency-like data in a seductive way, first and foremost, but as a side effect they tend to provide software support for mob-like phenomena. "
" Mitchell Baker "," So many commercial orgs have software where you can come and modify it, but they still control everything. And what's controlled is very clearly what's good for their business, or if they're more progressive, their view of what's good for the Internet. "
" Richard Stallman "," Proprietary software keeps users divided and helpless. Divided because each user is forbidden to redistribute it to others, and helpless because the users can't change it since they don't have the source code. They can't study what it really does. So the proprietary program is a system of unjust power. "
" Jonathan Zittrain "," With the rise of software patents, engineers coding new stuff - whether within a large software company or as kids writing smartphone apps - are exposed to a claim that somewhere a prior patent is being infringed. "
" Roger McGuinn "," Now, you can just get a laptop, get some software, put a microphone on it and make a record. You have to know how to do it. It does help if you've had 35 or 40 years of experience in the studio. But, it still levels the playing field so artists can record their own stuff. "
" Buffy Sainte-Marie "," Digital art software has empowered both the painterly side of photographers, and the photographer side of painters. "
" Niklas Zennstrom "," Then people started using it more and more and it became the most downloaded software on the internet. "
" Keith Barry "," Some computers have security software that make it impossible to hack into, and it's the same with brains - some malfunction, and some, you can't hack into them at all. "
" Eric Maskin "," Specifically, in the software industry, progress is highly sequential: progress is typically made through a large number of small steps, each building on the previous ones. "
" Daniel Wu "," For Mandarin scripts, there's software now where you can just insert the Chinese script, and it comes out all in pinyin. "
" Harold Ford, Jr. "," Lawmakers misrepresent the facts when they call the manufacturing deduction known as Section 199 - passed by Congress in 2004 to spur domestic job growth - a 'subsidy' for oil and gas firms. The truth is that all U.S. manufacturers, from software producers to filmmakers and coffee roasters, are eligible for this deduction. "
" John Hughes "," A geek is a guy who has everything going for him but he's just too young. He's got the software but he doesn't have the hardware yet. "
" Larry Ellison "," We have most of the software industry running Autonomy. "
" John Sulston "," I believe our basic information, our 'software', should be free and open for everyone to play with, to compete with, to try and make products from. I do not believe it should be under the control of one person. "
" Xavier Niel "," The most sought-after candidates in the world today by companies like mine are people who make computer software - there's a shortage of talent. "
" Louis Navellier "," I simply can't buy as much of some stocks such as Detection Systems or United Education & Software as I'd like because there just aren't all that many shares available. "
" Henry Samueli "," Anytime you put a challenge out there, people come up with a creative solution on the software side. "
" Henry Samueli "," We need to get smarter about hardware and software innovation in order to get the most value from the emerging Internet of Things. "
" Larry Wall "," I think software patents are a bad idea. Many patents are given for trivial inventions. "
" Larry Wall "," I want people to use Perl. I want to be a positive ingredient of the world and make my American history. So, whatever it takes to give away my software and get it used, that's great. "
" Clive Thompson "," Software is now so complex - requiring so many gazillions of tiny files all over your computer - that most consumers don't want to bother to know what's really going on. "
" Clive Thompson "," If you, or any public-spirited programmer, wanted to figure out what the software on your machine is really doing, tough luck. It's illegal to reverse engineer the source code of commercial software to find out how it works. "
" Steve Case "," One of the problems with computers, particularly for the older people, is they were befuddled by them, and the computers have gotten better. They have gotten easier to use. They have gotten less expensive. The software interfaces have made things a lot more accessible. "
" Pierre Omidyar "," In 1991, I co-founded my first start-up, Ink Development, which made software for an early tablet computer. "
" Mike Krieger "," Software is like gardening - one day I'll go behind the shed and clean up. But if nobody ever goes there, does it matter a lot? "
" Palmer Luckey "," Games take years to make, and it's important that when we launch, it can't just be a great launch catalog and then a desert for a really long time. To be honest, for a lot of developers, they'd rather not be competing at launch with all this other software. "
" Palmer Luckey "," Virtual reality is a tough sell for a software developer. They have to convince investors that not only are they going to build a good game, which is what they normally have to do, they have to convince them that it's going to be a good game and that virtual reality will be successful. "
" Bre Pettis "," My parents had a software company making children's software for the Apple II+, Commodore 64 and Acorn computers. They hired these teenagers to program the software, and these guys were true hackers, trying to get more colors and sound and animation out of those computers. "
" Phil Schiller "," From the beginning, the Mac has been about Apple taking responsibility for the whole thing: hardware, software, how applications can work, and, increasingly, Internet services. "
" Ren Ng "," If you think about all the light that enters - that enters the lens of a camera, that's much more than a photo. The light field is all the higher-dimensional information that's lost in a regular photo. When we record all this information, that provides us the opportunity in software after the fact. "
" Mike Shinoda "," The thing is, there are so many different ways to make music these days with virtual instruments, software applications, physical instruments, and computer programs. "
" Mike McCue "," In high school, I started my first company, called M Cubed Software. We named it that because it was me and two other guys named Mike. "
" Dweezil Zappa "," Modern records are all made with virtually identical gear, software plug-ins and everything. Everybody wants everything to sound like the last thing that was popular because they're chasing their tails. "
" Brendan I. Koerner "," The hazards posed by Near-Earth Asteroids are assessed by Sentry, a computer system developed by the Near-Earth Objects Group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. The software factors together a cosmic rock's coordinates, distance, velocity, and gravitational influences to calculate its trajectory. "
" Todd Park "," When I was 24, I co-founded a company called Athenahealth which built the first Web-based software and back-office service suite for doctors' offices. "
" Jim Barksdale "," We can collaborate with a Netscape employee or partner who's halfway around the world. We can distribute information and software to customers and shareholders, and get their feedback. "
" Jim Barksdale "," We can provide beta software to our developers in advance of the general public. We can easily link up with external partners, customers, and suppliers. "
" Jim Barksdale "," I think we're proving ourselves as we go along. The past several months our strategy has been evolutionary - making maximum advantage of our client browser, as well as our enterprise software for people who want to build Web sites. "
" Jim Barksdale "," I don't believe in government regulation of the software industry. "
" Dennis Crowley "," I feel lucky because earlier in my career, I found what I liked to do; it's build software that you see your friends using on the street, and they like it. "
" Allison Schroeder "," I interned at NASA for five years, and I grew up in Cape Canaveral, and my grandfather was an engineer on the Mercury capsule, and my grandmother was a software engineer. I literally grew up playing on the Mercury capsule prototypes. "
" Hasso Plattner "," The software industry has to become better in componentization. That's a clear focus for most of the software companies. How components look, how they are maintained, the ability to maintain them separately. "
" Lawrence Lessig "," While the creative works from the 16th century can still be accessed and used by others, the data in some software programs from the 1990s is already inaccessible. "
" Eric Whitacre "," Many composers use software to write music - programs like Finale or Sibelius. There are also recording programs. I should say I'm still very old-fashioned, I still use pencil and paper. But almost every composer I know does it the 'new way.' "
" Safra A. Catz "," My best decision was to choose to go to Wall Street over law. I learned a lot and focused on the expanding software industry at a time when the independent software industry was just beginning. "
" Safra A. Catz "," In 1986, Microsoft and Oracle went public within a day of each other, and I recall telling one of my colleagues that the software business will become big. So I started working with software companies in the mid-'80s and never turned back. "
" Adi Godrej "," We have a company, Geometric Software, which is into engineering services software. We have a company called Nature's Basket, which is into gourmet retailing. Both are specialized companies. "
" Nivin Pauly "," I was working as a software engineer in Infosys. I quit because I lost interest in it. I had a group of friends who wanted to make it big in films, and that's when the audition for 'Malarvady Arts Club' happened. I got selected, and it opened the doors to my dream world. "
" Brian L. Roberts "," We took the brains out of the set-top box and put it in the cloud. Having our software in the cloud gives consumers the ability to click their remote control and navigate through thousands of choices in a simple and elegant way. That's magic. "
" Calvin Harris "," Right at the start, when I was about 13 or 14, I only had an Amiga 500 Plus running a bit of tracker software called OctaMED. My brother was big into his computers, and when he moved up to a proper PC, I took charge of the Amiga. "
" Kent Beck "," I think it's a combination of technical and social factors that leads to all the defects in deployed software. "
" Kent Beck "," There's a huge latent market for software development that's just flat-out honest. "
" Kent Beck "," A rational model of software is to design it quickly - the economic pressure to improvise presents an interesting challenge. "
" Kent Beck "," People are looking for software development that actually does something useful... People are looking for partners who deliver when promised, and at a reasonable and transparent price. I believe that the days of being able to value price software are numbered. "
" Katie Hafner "," Using the HTTP protocol, computer scientists around the world began making the Internet easier to navigate by inventing point-and-click browsers. One browser in particular, called Mosaic, created in 1993 at the University of Illinois, would help popularize the Web, and therefore the Net, as no software tool had yet done. "
" Jay Chiat "," Our technology is very scalable. Our software can accommodate enormous numbers of clients. It's a marvelous opportunity. We'll keep developing products. "
" Miguel de Icaza "," Every piece of software written today is likely going to infringe on someone else's patent. "
" Miguel de Icaza "," The software patent problem is not limited to Mono. Software patents affect everyone writing software today. "
" Miguel de Icaza "," Our strategy in dealing with patents in Mono is the same strategy that any other software developer would take. In the event of a patent claim, we will try to find prior art to the claim of the patent. "
" Wietse Venema "," In a previous life I wrote the software that controlled my physics experiments. That software had to deal with all kinds of possible failures in equipment. That is probably where I learned to rely on multiple safety nets inside and around my systems. "
" Wietse Venema "," Qmail out of the box works fine, so people will want to use it regardless of licensing restrictions, even when the software does not ship with their system software. "
" Wietse Venema "," Like all software, Qmail can survive only when it keeps up with changing requirements. "
" John Maeda "," I don't like creating software anymore. It's too exact. It's like karate; there's no room for error. "
" Jan Chipchase "," Facial recognition software is already quite accurate in measuring unchanging and unique ratios between facial features that identify you as you. It's like a fingerprint. "
" Michael J. Saylor "," I basically got an education in software on DuPont's money because they were too stubborn to admit that a recession was coming. "
" Michael J. Saylor "," I think my software is going to become so ubiquitous, so essential, that if it stops working, there will be riots. "
" Michael J. Saylor "," The industries that fall first are the industries that either produce electromechanical items that are now inferior to their software substitutes, or the industries that produce a mechanically created service that's now inferior. "
" Michael J. Saylor "," Companies that make keys, credit card companies, any company in the service business - anything to do with a consumer is probably a software company. "
" Niklaus Wirth "," Indeed, the woes of Software Engineering are not due to lack of tools, or proper management, but largely due to lack of sufficient technical competence. "
" Niklaus Wirth "," Yet, I am convinced that there is a need for high quality software, and the time will come when it will be recognized that it is worth investing effort in its development and in using a careful, structured approach based on safe, structured languages. "
" Trip Hawkins "," From day one our next generation system will run all our exsisting software - so that gives us a head start. "
" Jaan Tallinn "," Once computers can program, they basically take over technological progress because already, today, the majority of technological progress is run by software, by programming. "
" Shawn Fanning "," Well, user feedback was excellent. Even when the software didn't work at all, there were few people who were avid users, and there were people who were just sending excellent feedback and excellent ideas. "
" Ryan Bethencourt "," Simple genome engineering of bacteria and yeast is just the beginning of the rise of the true biohackers. This is a community of several thousand people, with skill sets ranging from self-taught software hackers to biology postdocs who are impatient with the structure of traditional institutional lab work. "
" Justin Rosenstein "," Historically, software for business was seen as unsexy because the products were seen as so poor - they provided such a poor user experience. "
" Dave Sitek "," Pop belonged to more musical people in earlier times, but we've sort of gotten away from that. Now it's software people. I kind of feel like reclaiming it is in order. "
" Eric S. Raymond "," If Unix could present the same face, the same capabilities, on machines of many different types, it could serve as a common software environment for all of them. "
" Brian Behlendorf "," Corporations have been killing the risk-taking and exploration that makes software great. They have tried to rip the soul out of development. "
" Brian Behlendorf "," Software as an asset isn't stable over time; it needs to be maintained. "
" Jim Parrack "," My father is a retired army captain and banking software salesman, and my mother is an English teacher. "
" Daniel Suarez "," I wrote a piece of software in 1998 that created fictional weather. "
" Roberta Williams "," Computers have become more friendly, understandable, and lots of years and thought have been put into developing software to convince people that they want and need a computer. "
" Roy Romer "," Interactive computers and software will, I think, provide a less costly method of doing some kinds of inquiry, in knowledge acquisition and even reasoning and interaction. "
" Roy Romer "," You know, IBM was almost knocked out of the box by other types of computer software and manufacturing. "
" Kevin Lynch "," Just like the Internet has transformed the media industry or the e-commerce industry, the software industry is also being affected dramatically by the Internet. "
" Brian Kernighan "," Even though most people won't be directly involved with programming, everyone is affected by computers, so an educated person should have a good understanding of how computer hardware, software, and networks operate. "
" KSI "," When I was, like, 16 or 17, I was just finding out about this YouTube thing. Then I saved a bit and asked my parents for some help to get the recording software and equipment. "
" Renee James "," We're about getting all the people who want to compete with Samsung to be able to build devices. So we're kind of down at the guts level saying, 'Hey, we can give you the hardware, the sensor platform, the software you need to go build your own one.' "
" Jon Evans "," I'm a victim of Developaralysis: the crippling sense that the software industry is evolving so fast that no one person can possibly keep up. "
" Jon Evans "," As hardware doubles its density every 18-24 months, courtesy of Moore's Law, and as software eats the world, technology will replace a broad swathe of jobs outright - from burger-flippers to diagnosticians - and atomize many others from full-time positions into gigs performed by many fungible workers. Tech, in short, will eat jobs. "
" Jon Evans "," I've been a software engineer, a novelist, a journalist, and a manager - and managing developers is easily the trickiest thing I've ever done. "
" Jon Evans "," Governments are scared of software. "
" Jon Johansen "," I took a job in the U.S. because I wanted to work on products that would get into end users' hands. In Norway, most of the jobs are in server software, niche stuff. "
" Jane Jensen "," Before I became a game designer, I was a software engineer. "
" Seth Gordon "," I discovered shooting and filmmaking around the time all of the software became affordable to anyone with a PC. "
" Jairam Ramesh "," WTO is not the forum for labour standards. Next, the U.S. will argue the time zone difference is an unfair competitive advantage enjoyed by India that enables our software engineers to work while the Americans sleep. "
" Jim Allchin "," There is no neat distinction between operating system software and the software that runs on top of it. "
" Nadia Ali "," I write my songs many times to chord progressions on a piano. Unfortunately, I can't keep playing the piano, so I just record it into the software. "
" Robert Love "," Compounding the cost, most mapping software is processor-intense. "
" Suraj Sharma "," My ma is an economist. My dad is a software engineer. "
" Brenda Laurel "," I don't understand computers. I've been unable to construct a working mental model of how they do what they do. I can break software by looking at it. I can blow anything up. Without trying. It's sort of like being a dowser. And this extreme elaborate clumsiness on my part is actually something people will pay me for. It's quite wonderful. "
" Peter Fenton "," In open-source in general, the power lies in connecting the author of the software directly to users, eliminating the middleman. "
" Rob Pike "," The process of software development doesn't feel any better than it did a generation ago. "
" Osman Rashid "," As things go digital, the notion of new editions will go away. A publisher can add video and assessment content at scale, make the change in 30 seconds and it's just a software update. "
" David Pogue "," I'm always surprised at how many people seem to like reading about what hardware and software I use. "
" Pat Cadigan "," I took this 'how to build computers' course basically because I'm sick and tired of getting ripped off by cheesy computer companies. Software baffles me. I like hardware. I used to change my own oil, and now I want to build my own computer so I can have what I want. "
" Dan Kaminsky "," The reality of most software development is that the consequences of failure are simply nonexistent. "
" Dan Kaminsky "," Software tends not to kill people, and so we accept incredibly fast innovation loops because the consequences are tolerable and the results are astonishing. "
" Keith Rothfus "," I went to see the stock exchange when I was 18 years old. I'm not a Wall Street lawyer, I'm a Stanwix Street lawyer. Stanwix Street is a street in downtown Pittsburgh. One of the clients is Mellon Bank, which merged with the Bank of New York Mellon a number of years ago. And I have for years have done software licensing for Mellon. "
" Keith Rothfus "," I'm a transactional lawyer; I negotiate all types of things, but with a particular focus in software licenses. "
" Wang Leehom "," I write and do all my arrangements on my Mac. And um, I use Logic Pro, which is a great software program. "
" Golan Levin "," I think there's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what's possible on the computer. Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible, you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on. "
" David Wroblewski "," I set writing aside when I went into theater, and then I set theater aside and subsequently had about a 25-year career in software development. Which, by the way, is a very creative field. I equate it more to kinetic sculpture than anything else, as an activity. "
" David Wroblewski "," When you're making something big, whether it's long-form fiction or a big piece of software, whatever that is, you're having a very intimate and extended conversation with the work materials themselves. "
" Tony Hoare "," There are two methods in software design. One is to make the program so simple, there are obviously no errors. The other is to make it so complicated, there are no obvious errors. "
